# Telecom-Churn-Prediction-with-Machine-Learning-

•	Developed an end-to-end Python-based machine learning model to predict customer churn in the telecom industry which led to identifying at-risk customers and developing of targeted retention strategies.<br>
•	Employed SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) to address data imbalance issues and utilized Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce data dimensionality while preserving important information.<br>
•	Implemented and compared the performance of Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost algorithms with hyperparameter tuning for optimal results.<br>
•	Achieved the best performance with 80% accuracy, 79% sensitivity, and 21% specificity on unseen data using a Logistic Regression model, prioritizing high sensitivity to identify at-risk customers for targeted interventions.<br>
•	Identified key features influencing customer churn, enabling informed decision-making for retention strategies.<br>
